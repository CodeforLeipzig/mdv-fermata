Installation
------------

First, make sure you use the correct node version. The currently used
node version can be found in the `.nvmrc` file. If you use
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can use `nvm install` while
in the root directory to install the correct version and `nvm use` to
activate it.

To install the dependencies run `npm install` or `yarn`.
